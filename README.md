# PowerShell Deobfuscation Exercise
An exercise to practice deobfuscating PowerShell Scripts.  
  
The variable and function name make sense once you deobfuscate a little bit! I think I'm funny ðŸ¤£  
  
You can cheat and take out the last line and run the script to get the answer. The PowerPoint walks through each step though and has the answer at the end.
